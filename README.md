# Notion-UdeS

This project allows me to sync my homework list from a Notion database to my Google Calendar, using Notion's and Google's APIs.

In the Notion database, I just have to specify the homework title, which branch the homework is related to and the day the homework is due. The code uses a separate Notion database with the class schedules to know at what time to place the events in the calendar.
